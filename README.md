# balance
Day–Stout–Warren algorithm for balancing a tree


The program creates a BST from the main. 
It then uses DSW algorithm to balance the tree.
The program also produces a before and after drwaing of the tree. 
You can open the graphic files using windows play media; when trying 
to open, you are asked if you want to open it since media does not
recognize the extention. Say yes. It is perfectly safe. (I used
.TGA because it is easy to generate without any libs. The program
is self contained)
